Player places RRM
RRM is added to lowest numbered least full bucket
    Where are the buckets?
        One per device rate? Or is there a more elegant way?

All RRMs in a single bucket get run on that bucket's tick
If a bucket is empty on its tick then no RRMs run that tick


RRM.Buckets = {30 x {}}

processRRMS(global.Buckets.RRM[tick % 30])



\scripts\bucket.lua
bucket.initSet(name, interval) -- Creates global.Buckets.name[] with interval empty tables
bucket.add(entity) -- This function will choose buckets based on machine class
bucket.remove(bucketSetEntry)

\scripts\machine.lua
machine.tick(entity) -- If entity is gone will bucket.remove(entity)
machine.range(entity) -- Support function for some machines (like RRMs)

\scripts\helper.lua
helper.offsetDirection(location, direction, offset)
helper.offsetArea(location, direction, offset, radius)
