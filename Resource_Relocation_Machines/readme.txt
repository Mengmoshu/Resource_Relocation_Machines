Resource Relocation Machine:
    A 1x1 building that moves ores from behind it to in front of it, one at a time. Directional machine that moves resource entities to it's far side. Excludes oil patches,

    Place one of the machines and shortly it will begin moving ore from behind the machine to in front of it. It doesn't require power or fuel, and it doesn't produce pollution. They come in 10, 20, and 30 tile ranges, if you make the longer ranged ones they turn back into the basic one when you mine them. Don't worry, it doesn't cost any resources to upgrade them again.


A Note:
    I haven't refined this mod at all really, so be warned that the art is ugly, and the features are limited. For example, right now the machines are also fully functional Constant Combinators.
